Once upon a time, there was a software developer who wanna develop a voice-assistance app for his own work. 
This app is being built because he wanna create a desktop app, that is universal and essential for every computers.
By inputting the voice command, the "Voice assistance" app can answer in a natural and fluent way, also executing the command for the users. 

For example: Hey my beautifule Sarah (presume the name of the virtual assistance is Sarah), I wanna watch Youtube videos, wanna watch something fun after a long day at work. can you suggest for me, which is the best movie, or videos??

The beautiful assistance Sarah responded with an anwser: Why don't you try the latest ytb video on Tommy's Channel: "How to flirt a girl - How to start a natural conversation with a beautiful girl you met on the street"

And Sarah pops up youtube video on the screen without the users even navigating around the browser, around Ytb to find interesting videos.
